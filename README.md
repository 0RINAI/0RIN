# 0RIN Quantum-Safe MCP Client

This project provides a client application (qu3-app) for secure interaction with Quantum-Safe Multi-Compute Provider (MCP) environments. It leverages post-quantum cryptography (PQC) standards for establishing secure communication channels, ensuring client authenticity, and verifying server attestations.

This client is designed to work with MCP servers that support the QU3 interaction protocols. For development and testing, a compatible mock server implementation is included in scripts/mock_mcp_server.py.

Client Component Interaction
